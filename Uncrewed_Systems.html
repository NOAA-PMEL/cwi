          <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>This project explores the possibility of using different types of uncrewed observing systems (e.g., ocean gliders, saildrones, airdrones) in combination with conventional observing platforms (e.g., ships and aircraft) to measure the vertical profiles of the entire air-sea transition zone (the upper ocean, air-sea interface, and marine atmospheric boundary layer). One example of using such combined unscrewed systems is observing the air-sea transition zone within hurricanes that is otherwise almost impossible using crewed observing assets.
